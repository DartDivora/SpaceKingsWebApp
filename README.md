# SpaceKingsWebApp

This is the start of the Space Kings Web App! Eventually, this is meant to be a Web App used to play the tabletop game "Space Kings", but currently is just a proof of concept on using some key features in Angular 5.

### Getting started:
Here are some quick, but detailed instructions on how to get the project running locally.
 - First, download and install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). 
 - Second, pull down this repository using whatever tool you use (for example, Github Desktop.
 - Third, in a terminal (command prompt for Windows), run the following commands.
  - npm install - this will pull down all of the required dependencies.
  - npm start - this will start a web server (default port 3000) to host the web page, which should automatically open up in a browser
 - Now, you are set! As long as that terminal session is open, any modifications to the .ts files will automatically be updated.
